/**
 * What this particular phone can actually decode, asked once and remembered.
 *
 * One question so far, and it is the one the rest of the app is otherwise free
 * to ignore all the way to silence: **Dolby Atmos**. E-AC-3 is licensed, so its
 * decoder ships with the *vendor* image rather than with Android —
 * `c2.dolby.eac3.decoder` is present on the Samsung this was traced on and
 * absent on plenty of devices that look identical from up here. Nothing else in
 * the app ever asked, so an Atmos rendition was handed to the player on every
 * device alike.
 *
 * Asked here, before the URL is returned, rather than left to the player,
 * because of how badly the player fails at it. A format no renderer supports is
 * not reliably an *error*: `DefaultTrackSelector` declines to select a track
 * whose support is `FORMAT_UNSUPPORTED_SUBTYPE`, the period then ends with no
 * renderer enabled, and the queue moves on — a song that skipped itself
 * instantly, with no exception for
 * [PlaybackService.recoverFrom][com.music.swara.playback.PlaybackService] to
 * recover from and nothing on screen to explain it. The other half of the time
 * it is a decoder-init failure, which recovers, but only by spending the
 * attempt budget and landing on YouTube. Both are worse than never offering the
 * rendition.
 *
 * ### Getting the answer right
 *
 * The verdict has to be the *renderer's* verdict, because the renderer is who
 * acts on it, and a hand-rolled second opinion that disagrees is worse than no
 * opinion at all — a false yes is the silent skip above, and a false no quietly
 * drops a capable flagship to YouTube for every Atmos track it will ever play.
 * So [MediaCodecUtil] is asked first: it is precisely what `MediaCodecSelector`
 * hands `MediaCodecAudioRenderer`, including Media3's per-device workarounds
 * and its blocklists for decoders that are advertised and don't work.
 *
 * Both mime types are asked for. A decoder that declares plain `audio/eac3` can
 * carry a JOC stream — the height objects are dropped and what comes out is the
 * 5.1 core downmixed, which is a lesser render but not a failure — and Media3
 * will fall back to one for exactly that reason. Asking for only the JOC mime
 * would refuse Atmos on every device that ships the ordinary E-AC-3 decoder.
 *
 * [MediaCodecList] is then a backstop rather than the primary answer, for the
 * case where the Media3 query throws (`DecoderQueryException` is a real
 * outcome on a device whose codec list is malformed). `REGULAR_CODECS`
 * deliberately, not `ALL_CODECS`: the extra entries in the full list exist only
 * for specific configurations, and counting them is how you end up saying yes
 * to a decoder the renderer will not be given.
 *
 * ### What this does not cover
 *
 * Passthrough. A phone with no decoder at all can still send E-AC-3 to a
 * receiver that has one, over HDMI or a capable USB interface, and Media3 will
 * do that when `AudioCapabilities` says the *current route* supports the
 * encoding. That answer changes when headphones are plugged in, so it cannot be
 * cached, and it is false on a phone's own speaker and over Bluetooth — which
 * is where this app is listened to. The cost of leaving it out is that someone
 * running a phone into an AVR sees the toggle greyed out; the cost of putting
 * it in is a capability that flickers with the audio route. Left out knowingly.
