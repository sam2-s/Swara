/**
 * One in-flight-or-recent answer per key, shared by everyone who asks for it.
 *
 * Nothing below a module's index was shared or kept before this, and the
 * index is the cheap half: it is one document that changes almost never, while
 * `searchTracks` and `getTrackStreamUrl` are live calls into somebody else's
 * backend. Measured on one track, in one ninety-second window, against one
 * module — 'What Did I Miss?' was searched twice for the identical query and
 * asked twice for the identical track's stream URL. None of that is a bug in
 * any one caller. A track simply passes this way several times over — the live
 * resolve, the second look under the music, the lossless pass after a lossy
 * swap, a re-resolve when the player reopens the source — and every one of
 * those started from nothing.
 *
 * Two things are shared here, and they are not the same thing:
 *
 *  - **In flight**, always, whatever [ttlMs] says. Two callers asking the same
 *    question at the same moment is the ordinary case in this layer, because
 *    a search and a stream lookup overlap across tracks.
 *  - **Completed**, for [ttlMs]. Zero means in-flight only, which is right for
 *    an answer that depends on state this cannot see.
 *
 * ### Why the work is not started in the caller's scope
 *
 * Because this layer's callers are *designed* to give up. [ModuleSource.search]
 * launches every module in an index at once and cancels the losers;
 * [SourceResolver.bestAcross][com.music.swara.data.sources.SourceResolver]
 * cancels every source still running as soon as one of them answers. Started in
 * the caller's scope, each of those cancellations tore down a request that had
 * already reached the module's server — so the server did the work, answered,
 * and found nobody listening. From the far end that is indistinguishable from a
 * client hammering it and hanging up, and it was a large part of what the
 * module's operator was seeing.
 *
 * Given a [scope] that outlives any one caller, a cancelled caller drops its
 * `await` and nothing else. The request finishes and lands here, where it is
 * usually wanted again moments later anyway.
 *
 * ### What is not kept
 *
 * A failure. A module that was briefly unreachable should be asked again on the
 * next track rather than written off for the window — the same rule
 * [ModuleManager.fetchIndex] applies, for the same reason. An *empty* answer is
 * not a failure: "this catalogue does not have that recording" is a real answer,
 * and re-asking for it is exactly the waste this exists to stop.
