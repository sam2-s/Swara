/**
 * Attaches the WebDAV credential to cover loads aimed at the configured
 * server.
 *
 * Coil fetches with its own transport, which never passes through
 * [Http.client][com.music.swara.data.Http]'s interceptor — so without this
 * every in-app cover (rows, sleeve, palette, mesh, widget) goes out without
 * `Authorization`, comes back 401, and reads as "this track has no artwork".
 * ExoPlayer's surfaces never had the problem; they share the app's client.
 *
 * Runs on every image request in the app, so it decides on strings alone and
 * touches nothing else: non-WebDAV hosts and requests that already carry a
 * credential pass through unchanged.
