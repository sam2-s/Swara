/**
 * The home-screen widget: the cover of what's playing, with a transport across
 * the foot of it.
 *
 * Two providers, [MediaWidgetSquare] and [MediaWidgetWide], so the picker offers
 * a square one and a full-width one — but they are the same widget, and both can
 * be resized across the whole range. What they differ in is the size they arrive
 * at. Which of the two layouts a given instance draws is decided from its
 * *measured* width ([WIDE_LAYOUT_MIN_DP]), not from which provider it came from,
 * so a square dragged out to four cells sets its title beside the buttons and
 * picks up the artist, and a wide one squeezed back to two stacks the title over
 * them instead — rather than either being stuck with a layout its size doesn't
 * suit.
 *
 * Everything visual except the transport itself is one bitmap, drawn by
 * [MediaWidgetArt] — see there for why the blur has to work that way.
