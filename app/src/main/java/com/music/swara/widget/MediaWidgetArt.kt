/**
 * The single image a widget draws: the album cover, filling it edge to edge,
 * with its bottom dissolving into a blur for the transport to sit on.
 *
 * All of it is baked into one bitmap because a widget cannot blur anything at
 * runtime — [android.widget.RemoteViews] has no RenderEffect, no Haze, no
 * shaders, and no way to reach a view's render node. So the effect the app gets
 * live from
 * [BottomFadeBlur][com.music.swara.ui.components.BottomFadeBlur] has to be
 * drawn here instead, once per track, on the CPU.
 *
 * That component is also where the shape of it comes from, and it is worth
 * repeating its two findings because they are the whole difference between a
 * blur that reads as artwork dissolving and one that reads as a panel stuck over
 * a picture:
 *
 *  - The blur has to **ramp in over a region far taller than the bar it serves**
 *    (180dp of fade for a bar a fraction of that), and spend most of that run
 *    too faint to notice. The long invisible lead-in is what hides the line
 *    where the effect begins. Here that is [BLUR_REGION_SCALE].
 *  - It has to **stop short of full**, because a blur has nothing to sample past
 *    the edge of its own layer, so the harder it is pushed at that edge the more
 *    of what is left is flat colour rather than blurred content — and flat
 *    colour at the bottom of the artwork is exactly the band being avoided.
 *    Here that is the cap on [BLUR_SIGMAS].
 *
 * The ramp is four progressively blurrier copies of the bottom of the cover,
 * drawn back over it softest-first, each masked by a vertical alpha gradient
 * starting lower than the last — which adds up to a blur that accelerates
 * downwards. Each copy is a separable box blur ([blurInPlace]) run on a
 * quarter-ish-scale working image and sampled back up.
 *
 * The strengths cannot come from the downscale itself — from a mip pyramid, the
 * obvious cheap trick. Halving does average each 2×2 block, so a mip really is
 * blurred, but it holds one *sample* per block, and reconstructing a full-size
 * image from samples that far apart is bilinear interpolation between them: at
 * the strengths a band this size needs, the last mip is a handful of pixels
 * across and what lands on screen is its grid, as big soft rectangles. Blurring
 * *after* the downscale instead is what avoids that — it leaves the working
 * image with no detail finer than its own pixels, which is precisely the
 * condition under which sampling back up adds nothing visible.
