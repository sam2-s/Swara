 * The signed-in library: the saved collections, as shelves of cards.

 * Deliberately only the collections. This page used to end with two runs of
 * track rows — "Liked Music" and "Songs" — which are two overlapping answers
 * to the same question and read as one list that couldn't make up its mind: a
 * track that stopped being liked didn't leave the page, it moved down it, into
 * a section most people had taken for more of the same. Liked Music is a
 * playlist, and it is reached the way every other playlist here is, by opening
 * its card.
 *
 * The liked list is still fetched — it is what the rest of the app reads a
 * track's rating off (see MainViewModel's `likeStatuses`); it just isn't a
 * second place to browse it.

/**
 * The way in to Replay, at the top of the page.
 *
 * On the Library tab rather than a tab of its own because that is what Replay
 * is — a view of what is already yours, alongside the playlists and the
 * downloads. A fifth tab would give a page most people open a handful of times
 * a year the same standing as Search.
 *
 * ## Why it is painted the way the cards are
 *
 * The mesh is the same one the Replay cards and the player's backdrop run —
 * sampled from the artwork of the record the period was mostly spent on, and
 * drifting rather than settling (see [MeshGradientBackground]'s `continuous`).
 * A fixed brand gradient here looked like a promo banner, which is the one thing
 * this must not be: it advertises the user's own listening, so it should be lit
 * by the user's own listening, and it should not look like anything else on the
 * page. With nothing played yet the mesh falls back to its stock colours, which
 * is a perfectly good button and still not a red rectangle.
 *
 * A single wide strip rather than a shelf of cards: there is exactly one of it,
 * and a carousel with one item in it always reads as a carousel that failed to
 * load the rest.
