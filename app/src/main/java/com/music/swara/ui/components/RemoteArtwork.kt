/**
 * A drawable art URL for [song]: its own thumbnail when it has one, else the
 * embedded picture pulled out of the remote file and cached — else null.
 *
 * The extraction only ever runs for remote-library tracks with no thumbnail;
 * every other row resolves synchronously to what it already had, so this is
 * safe to call from shared components like [SongRow] that draw every library
 * in the app. Keyed on the track id, so a recycled row re-resolves instead
 * of flashing a stranger's cover.
