/**
 * A party invite as a square somebody else can point a camera at.
 *
 * Drawn rather than decoded into a bitmap. ZXing hands back a bit matrix and
 * this paints it, which costs nothing extra — the matrix is the expensive part
 * — and buys the two things a stock QR bitmap cannot give: the modules are
 * rounded to match every other shape in the app, and the colours come from the
 * theme instead of being baked black on white.
 *
 * Painted once, off the main thread, into an [ImageBitmap]. Both halves of the
 * work are too heavy to sit in a frame: encoding walks the matrix several times
 * over, and a version-7 code is two thousand rounded rectangles, which is two
 * thousand draw calls on *every* frame of the sheet sliding up if the painting
 * happens in a [androidx.compose.foundation.Canvas]. Once it is a bitmap the
 * sheet's animation is blitting one image, and the encode has already happened
 * on [Dispatchers.Default] while the drawer was opening.
 *
 * [ErrorCorrectionLevel.M] rather than the default L: this gets photographed
 * off a phone screen at an angle, often a cracked one, and M tolerates about
 * 15% of the code being unreadable for a matrix only slightly denser.
