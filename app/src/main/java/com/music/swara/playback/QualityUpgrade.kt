/**
 * The second look: a track that started on less than was asked for gets the
 * question asked again, properly, while it plays.
 *
 * The live path has to answer in the time a listener will wait for a track to
 * start, and it buys that by giving up on the slow catalogue — which is
 * regularly the one holding the lossless copy. Measured on this device: the
 * fastest module answered a search in 1.3s and the slowest in 5.4s, and the
 * slow one then took a further 8.2s to walk its own fallback chain down to a
 * 128kbps MP3. Waiting for all of that costs 14 seconds of silence; not
 * waiting costs the FLAC. Neither is a good trade, and neither has to be made
 * once the search can happen with sound already coming out of the speaker.
 *
 * So: play whatever can be had now, then look again with no time limit, and
 * swap only if the answer is genuinely the same recording *and* genuinely
 * better than what is playing — which is usually the lossless copy that was
 * asked for, but is also a 320kbps module stream against YouTube's 160kbps
 * Opus. See [SourceResolver.worthSwapping] for where that line is drawn.
 * The swap is not free — ExoPlayer cannot change sources
 * gaplessly mid-track, so there is a short break in the audio — which is why
 * every guard here errs towards not doing it. A missed upgrade is a quieter
 * failure than an interrupted song.
 *
 * ### How the swap reaches the player
 *
 * The queue holds `swara://watch?v=…` URIs that
 * [PlaybackService][PlaybackService]'s resolving data source turns into real
 * URLs at open time. An upgrade re-points that indirection rather than
 * touching the queue: the stream is parked in [forced], the item is replaced
 * with the same URI plus a `q=` marker, and the marker does two jobs — it
 * makes the item unequal to its old self so Media3 actually rebuilds the media
 * source, and it keys the disk cache separately so the FLAC is not written
 * into the middle of the half-cached MP3 it is replacing.

     *   Measured on the track that was reported — 'The Night We Met', upgraded
     *   to Tidal's AAC 320 in one session and restarted into its YouTube Opus:
     *
     *   ```
     *     17:39:47.471  90DKXLbzLto <- audio/opus 48.0kHz bitrate n/a
     *     17:39:47.518  is playing from cache and was never resolved; looking…
     *     17:39:55      three candidates, each "offered 320 kbps; looking further"
     *     ——— nothing ———
     *   ```
     *
     *   The second look ran, found the same 320kbps copy it had swapped in
     *   twenty minutes earlier, and [SourceResolver.worthSwapping] dropped all
     *   three on `playing?.kbps ?: return false`. There is no lossless copy of
     *   that track behind any configured module — the one advertising FLAC in
     *   search serves AAC from its stream endpoint — so the listener got the
     *   "Upgrading Quality" badge, then silence on it, then Opus for the rest
     *   of the session. Against the real floor the gain is 320 − ~160, which
     *   clears [SourceResolver.worthSwapping]'s minimum twice over.

     * scopes that to one playback: *for as long as it lasts*. Nothing enforced
     * the scope. The set is keyed by media id alone and survives the track
     * ending, so playing the same song twice in one session went:
     *
     * ```
     *   23:38:28  substituted: 'Gehra Hua' … over YouTube at Dolby Atmos   ← asked += i1o1p_DD6TU
     *   23:44:07  TIMING track selected: i1o1p_DD6TU (reason=3)            ← and nothing at all

     * The second play is a different stream from the one the verdict was
     * reached about. The upgraded bytes live under their own rendition key and

     * fresh entry reads the *base* cache entry — the 146kbps Opus YouTube
     * served before the upgrade — and [couldStillUpgrade] then refuses it a
     * second look on the strength of a yes that applied to the copy it is no
     * longer playing. The track plays worse the second time than the first,
     * for the rest of the process, and silently: this is the cheap main-thread
     * check, so nothing is logged when it says no.
     *
     * Guarded on the marker rather than cleared unconditionally. An item that
     * *is* the upgraded copy — or a hand-reverted `q=original` — is already
     * excluded by [couldStillUpgrade] on its own terms, and re-opening those
     * would have the swap that just happened looked for again. And this is a
     * transition, not a progress sample, so it cannot reinstate the every-five-
     * seconds offer that [asked] exists to prevent: pausing and resuming does
     * not come through here.

     *   ordinary queue entry, set on an upgraded or hand-reverted one. Taken
