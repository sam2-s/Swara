/**
 * Whether the URL serving a track points at audio or at an index of it.
 *
 * A source module's stream URL is whatever its backend feels like serving, and
 * that is not always a file. Tidal answers a lossless or Dolby Atmos request
 * with an MPEG-DASH manifest, and answered the same request with an HLS one
 * until September 2026 — same track, same tier, no version change on our side.
 * Media3 plays both perfectly well, through `DashMediaSource` and
 * `HlsMediaSource`. What it will not do is work out which of those to build
 * after the fact: `DefaultMediaSourceFactory` chooses off the [MediaItem]
 * before a byte is fetched, and this app's playback URIs are
 * `swara://watch?v=…` and `swara://source?…`. Neither carries an
 * extension to infer from, so the choice defaults to a progressive source — and
 * a progressive source handed a manifest fails on the only error it can raise:
 * it offers the XML to every extractor it has and none of them can sniff it.
 *
 * ```
 *   15:11:53  substituted: 'What Did I Miss?' served by Ricky's Addon over YouTube at Dolby Atmos
 *   15:11:54  playback failed for Lx4gPURH35g at 0ms (ERROR_CODE_PARSING_CONTAINER_UNSUPPORTED)
 *             None of the available extractors (FlvExtractor, FlacExtractor, …) could read the stream
 *             sniff failures: [NoDeclaredBrand, NoDeclaredBrand]
 * ```
 *
 * That URL was not broken, which is the whole reason this exists. Sixteen
 * seconds later the identical URL — same signature, same expiry — played as
 * Dolby Atmos, because it arrived through [QualityUpgrade]'s swap, the one path
 * that declared the type. The failure above was read as a dead stream instead:
 * the track was struck off substitution *and* off automatic upgrades for the
 * session, and only the player menu's "Upgrade quality" could clear that.
 *
 * So the question "what is on the end of this URL" gets one answer, asked in
 * three places — where an upgrade builds its item, where the live path decides
 * whether it may substitute at all, and where a track that failed anyway is put
 * back on its feet.
 *
 * Judged on the extension, deliberately, and not on what the module said the
 * codec was: `format: "flac"` describes the audio inside and says nothing about
 * the envelope the URL points at.

     * Media3's [androidx.media3.exoplayer.source.ProgressiveMediaSource]
     * accepts an updated [androidx.media3.common.MediaItem] in place when its
     * URI, image duration and custom cache key are unchanged. MIME type is not
     * part of that decision. Consequently, replacing an item with the same URI
     * plus `application/dash+xml` only updates the old progressive source; it
     * does not send the item back through `DefaultMediaSourceFactory` to build
     * a DASH source.
     *
     * The marker changes only the app's virtual `swara://` URI. The resolver
     * ignores it, and [AudioCache] keys YouTube tracks from `v`/`q` and source
     * tracks from `s`/`t`, so it neither changes the real stream selected nor
     * invents another cache rendition. Its sole job is to make Media3 construct
     * the correctly typed source.
     *
     * Kept as a string operation so this rule remains testable on the plain JVM
     * without Android's `Uri` implementation.
