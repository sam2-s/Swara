/**
 * The tracks the listener has sent back to YouTube's own upload by hand, and
 * wants kept there.
 *
 * "Revert to original" used to be a fact about one queue entry: the item was
 * replaced with a direct-YouTube one — see [Song.toDirectYouTubeMediaItem] —
 * and that was the end of it. Play the same song again tomorrow, or reach the
 * end of the queue and come back round to it, and the whole substitution and
 * upgrade machinery started over from nothing and put the listener right back
 * on the copy they had just rejected. A revert is not a preference about a
 * moment; it is the listener saying this catalogue match is wrong for this
 * song, and the only useful lifetime for that is "until they say otherwise".
 *
 * So it is written down. [Song.toMediaItem] reads this wherever a queue entry
 * is built — from a list, from Android Auto, from the restart snapshot — and a
 * pinned track is built as the direct-YouTube item it was reverted to. That
 * covers process death, which is the case a purely in-memory set would miss and
 * the one most likely to be noticed, because the queue is restored from disk.
 *
 * "Upgrade quality" in the player's menu is the way back out — see
 * [PlaybackService][com.music.swara.playback.PlaybackService]'s
 * `ACTION_UPGRADE_QUALITY`. Nothing else clears an entry: an upgrade the app
 * decided on by itself must not overturn one the listener asked for, which is
 * exactly what the automatic path would do given the chance.
