/**
 * Which output the music is coming out of, and which one the listener asked for.
 *
 * Two halves that have to be kept apart, because the obvious API for each is
 * the wrong one.
 *
 * ## Showing where the audio is: not MediaRouter
 *
 * Reading [android.media.MediaRouter]'s selected route back gives an answer that
 * changes while a Bluetooth profile is connecting, so the name under the
 * transport flickered between the speaker and the headset that was plainly
 * playing. [outputs] works it out from the connected-device list instead, which
 * is a pure function and therefore steady.
 *
 * ## Changing where the audio goes: only the player can
 *
 * An unprivileged app cannot move the system's media routing. `MediaRouter`'s
 * `selectRoute` is ignored, and `MediaRouter2.transferTo` was measured doing
 * nothing at all here — STREAM_MUSIC stayed on `bt_a2dp` across the call.
 * Moving the system route needs MEDIA_ROUTING_CONTROL, which is privileged.
 *
 * What is left, and what works, is
 * [ExoPlayer.setPreferredAudioDevice][androidx.media3.exoplayer.ExoPlayer.setPreferredAudioDevice]:
 * it re-points our own AudioTrack. See `PlaybackService.applyOutputRoute`.
 *
 * **The sink handed to it has to be one that can play music**, and that is the
 * whole of the difficulty. A pair of Bluetooth earbuds publishes two devices
 * under one name — `TYPE_BLUETOOTH_A2DP` for media and `TYPE_BLUETOOTH_SCO` for
 * telephony — and pointing the track at the SCO one does not fail loudly. The
 * audio comes out of the phone speaker instead, at the *Bluetooth* volume index
 * (7/15 against the speaker's own 15/15, measured) because the system's own
 * route never moved, and the volume slider writes that same unreachable index.
 * It reads as "switching did nothing except break the volume". So SCO is not
 * offered at all, and A2DP wins any tie — see [kindOf] and [preferenceWithin].
 *
 * ## Why the selection is not persisted
 *
 * An [AudioDeviceInfo.getId] is valid for as long as that device stays connected
 * and no longer — the same headphones come back with a different id after a
 * reconnect, and a stored id would either match nothing or, eventually, match
 * something else entirely. So a choice lasts as long as the device does, and
 * unplugging falls back to [systemDefault] on its own rather than stranding
 * playback on a sink that is gone.
