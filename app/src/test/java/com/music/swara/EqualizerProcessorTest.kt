/**
 * What the equaliser actually does to a signal.
 *
 * The risk this covers is not that the code throws — it is that a filter is
 * quietly the wrong shape. A state-variable section with a mistyped output mix
 * still runs, still sounds like *something*, and is indistinguishable by ear
 * from one that is correct until you go looking for the decibels you asked for.
 * So every test here measures: a sine goes in, its amplitude is read out of the
 * result by correlation at the frequency it was generated at, and the gain is
 * compared against what the curve promised.
