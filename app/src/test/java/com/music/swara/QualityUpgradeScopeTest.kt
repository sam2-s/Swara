/**
 * How long an upgrade verdict is allowed to stand.
 *
 * `asked` records that a track has had its second look, so the every-five-
 * seconds offer from the cached-track path stops pestering a track already
 * dealt with. That is the right scope *within one playback* and the wrong
 * scope across two: the upgraded bytes live under their own rendition key and
 * the marked item URI goes with the queue entry that carried it, so the next
 * play of the same song reads the base cache entry — the YouTube copy — while
 * the verdict from the previous play says the question is settled.
 *
 * Measured on a device, same process, one session:
 *
 * ```
 *   23:38:28  substituted: 'Gehra Hua' … over YouTube at Dolby Atmos
 *   23:44:07  TIMING track selected: i1o1p_DD6TU (reason=3)   ← Opus, and no lookup at all
 * ```
