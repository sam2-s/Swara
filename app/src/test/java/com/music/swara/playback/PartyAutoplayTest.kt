/**
 * The two questions AutoPlay asks before it does anything in a party: whether it
 * is on at all, and whose job it is to top the queue up.
 *
 * Both used to be answered in the playback service, where nothing could reach
 * them — and the first was answered a second time, differently, by the player
 * that draws the toggle. These tests exist because that divergence is invisible
 * from either side: each answer is reasonable on its own, and only together do
 * they produce a switch that reads "on" over a party getting no suggestions.
